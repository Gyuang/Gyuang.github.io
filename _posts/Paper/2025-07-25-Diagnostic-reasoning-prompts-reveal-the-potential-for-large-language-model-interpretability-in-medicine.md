## Introduction

One of the major barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in medicine is the perception they use uninterpretable "black box" methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from clinicians' cognitive processes. This study develops diagnostic reasoning prompts that enable GPT-4 to mimic clinical reasoning while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, potentially addressing the interpretability barrier that limits safe adoption of LLMs in medical practice.


## Methods

The researchers developed several diagnostic reasoning prompts modeled after established clinical cognitive processes:

1. **Differential Diagnosis Formation**: Prompts that guide the model to systematically generate and rank multiple diagnostic possibilities based on clinical presentation
2. **Analytical Reasoning**: Step-by-step logical analysis prompts that break down clinical problems into component parts and reason through each systematically
3. **Intuitive Reasoning**: Prompts designed to capture pattern recognition and rapid diagnostic impressions similar to experienced clinicians' "clinical intuition"
4. **Bayesian Inference**: Probabilistic reasoning prompts that incorporate prior probabilities and likelihood ratios to update diagnostic confidence
5. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Comparison**: Traditional CoT prompting used as baseline comparison against specialized diagnostic reasoning approaches
6. **Structured Evaluation Framework**: Each prompting method was tested on identical clinical vignettes to ensure fair comparison of reasoning approaches
7. **Interpretability Assessment**: Human expert evaluation of whether LLM reasoning processes resembled authentic clinical thought patterns





## Dataset

The study utilized two main clinical datasets to evaluate diagnostic reasoning capabilities:

**Challenging Clinical Cases**: A set of previously unpublished complex diagnostic scenarios designed to test advanced clinical reasoning skills and differential diagnosis formation.

**Common Clinical Scenarios**: A collection of 45 clinical vignettes representing frequently encountered medical presentations in clinical practice, used to assess baseline diagnostic accuracy across routine cases.

## Results

The diagnostic reasoning prompts demonstrated significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability:

**Diagnostic Accuracy**: GPT-4 achieved 61.1% accuracy in top 6 diagnoses for challenging clinical cases, substantially outperforming the previously reported 49.1% accuracy of human physicians. For common clinical scenarios, GPT-4 included the correct diagnosis in its top 3 diagnoses 100% of the time.

**Clinical Reasoning Mimicry**: The specialized diagnostic reasoning prompts successfully enabled GPT-4 to replicate authentic clinical cognitive processes, with expert evaluators confirming that the model's reasoning patterns closely resembled those of practicing clinicians. This finding addresses the critical interpretability barrier by providing physicians with familiar reasoning frameworks to evaluate LLM recommendations and build appropriate trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.

## Conclusion
