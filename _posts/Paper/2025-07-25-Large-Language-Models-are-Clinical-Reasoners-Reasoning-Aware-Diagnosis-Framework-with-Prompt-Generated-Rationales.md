# Large Language Models are Clinical Reasoners: Reasoning-Aware Diagnosis Framework with Prompt-Generated Rationales

## 논문 정보
- **저자**: 연구진
- **발표**: AI Conference
- **ArXiv**: N/A

## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
Large Language Models are Clinical Reasoners: Reasoning-Aware Diagnosis Framework with Prompt-Generated Rationales에 대한 혁신적인 연구로, 해당 분야에 중요한 기여를 제공합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Clinical diagnosis requires complex reasoning that involves analyzing symptoms, medical history, and clinical findings to reach accurate conclusions, yet most existing medical NLP systems focus only on classification without providing interpretable reasoning pathways. This paper introduces a reasoning-aware diagnosis framework that leverages large language models to generate clinical rationales through prompt-based learning, eliminating the need for expensive clinician annotations while providing transparent diagnostic reasoning that mirrors clinical decision-making processes.

## 4. 실험 및 결과

### 4.1 실험 설정
The reasoning-aware diagnosis framework demonstrated significant improvements in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality compared to baseline approaches. On the MIMIC-III dataset, the framework achieved 89.2% diagnostic accuracy (vs. 83.1% for standard classification baselines) while generating clinically coherent rationales that aligned with physician reasoning patterns. The DDXPlus evaluation showed 92.7% accuracy with substantial improvements in differential diagnosis ranking, where the generated rationales helped identify relevant alternative diagnoses. Human evaluation by clinical experts rated 85% of generated rationales as clinically plausible and useful for diagnostic decision support, with particular strength in symptom analysis and evidence integration steps of the reasoning process.
