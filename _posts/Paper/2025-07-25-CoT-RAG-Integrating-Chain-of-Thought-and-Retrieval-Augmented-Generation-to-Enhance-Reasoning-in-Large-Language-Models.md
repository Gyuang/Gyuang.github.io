## Introduction

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly improves large language models' performance on complex reasoning tasks, it suffers from reliability issues when solely depending on LLM-generated reasoning chains and interference from natural language steps with the models' inference logic. CoT-RAG addresses these limitations by integrating Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, leveraging knowledge graphs to generate more reliable and grounded reasoning chains that enhance the overall reasoning capabilities of large language models.

## Methods

CoT-RAG integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation through a systematic three-component framework:

1. **Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation**: Constructs reasoning chains by retrieving relevant entities and relationships from structured knowledge graphs, ensuring factual grounding at each reasoning step

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning**: Enhances each step of the CoT process by retrieving relevant external knowledge from both structured (knowledge graphs) and unstructured (text corpora) sources to support reasoning decisions

3. **Iterative Refinement Process**: Continuously refines reasoning chains by cross-validating retrieved information with generated reasoning steps, identifying and correcting potential inconsistencies or gaps

4. **Multi-source Knowledge Integration**: Combines information from multiple knowledge sources including domain-specific knowledge graphs, general encyclopedic knowledge, and contextual information to create comprehensive reasoning paths

5. **Reasoning Chain Validation**: Implements a validation mechanism that scores and ranks different reasoning paths based on their consistency with retrieved knowledge and logical coherence

6. **Dynamic Retrieval Strategy**: Adapts retrieval queries based on the current reasoning context and previously generated steps, ensuring relevant knowledge acquisition throughout the reasoning process

## Dataset

The evaluation was conducted on multiple reasoning benchmarks to assess CoT-RAG's effectiveness across different reasoning types. The datasets included mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH), commonsense reasoning (CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA), and multi-hop reasoning challenges (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA). Knowledge graphs used for retrieval included domain-specific graphs such as ConceptNet for commonsense knowledge and specialized mathematical knowledge bases. The evaluation setup ensured comprehensive coverage of reasoning scenarios while maintaining consistency in knowledge retrieval and reasoning chain generation across all benchmark tasks.





## Results

CoT-RAG demonstrated significant improvements over standard Chain-of-Thought reasoning across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving 8-15% performance gains on mathematical reasoning tasks and 5-12% improvements on commonsense reasoning challenges. The framework showed particular strength in multi-hop reasoning scenarios, where the integration of retrieved knowledge helped maintain reasoning consistency across longer inference chains. Ablation studies revealed that knowledge graph-driven retrieval contributed most significantly to performance gains, while the iterative refinement process proved crucial for maintaining reasoning quality. The method also demonstrated improved reasoning interpretability, with human evaluators rating CoT-RAG generated explanations as more coherent and factually grounded compared to standard CoT approaches.
