## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
이 논문의 핵심 기여와 주요 발견을 간결하게 요약합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) systems often focus solely on answer accuracy while neglecting the critical reasoning pathways that clinicians require for diagnosis, limiting their practical applicability in clinical settings. V2T-CoT (Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought) addresses this limitation by introducing a novel framework that combines disease-specific region localization with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling both accurate diagnosis and interpretable medical reasoning pathways that mirror clinical decision-making processes.

## 3. 제안 방법

### 3.1 아키텍처 개요


### 3.2 핵심 기술/알고리즘
Existing vision-language models in medical domains primarily focus on global image understanding without explicit reasoning pathways, limiting their clinical interpretability.



Traditional computer vision approaches for medical diagnosis lack the multi-modal reasoning capabilities necessary for comprehensive clinical decision support.



V2T-CoT implements a three-stage pipeline that mimics clinical diagnostic reasoning by combining visual analysis, region localization, and structured reasoning:



The framework consists of three integrated components working in sequence to generate both accurate diagnoses and interpretable reasoning pathways.




1. **Vision Encoder Stage**: Extract comprehensive visual features from medical images using a pre-trained vision transformer that captures both global context and fine-grained anatomical details necessary for medical analysis

2. **Region Localization Module**: Identify and segment disease-specific regions of interest (ROIs) using attention mechanisms that highlight pathological areas, ensuring the model focuses on clinically relevant image regions rather than irrelevant background

3. **Chain-of-Thought Generator**: Generate structured reasoning sequences that mirror clinical diagnostic workflows by:
   - Analyzing identified ROIs systematically
   - Describing observed pathological features in medical terminology
   - Connecting visual observations to potential diagnostic hypotheses
   - Providing step-by-step logical reasoning leading to final diagnosis

4. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrate visual features from localized regions with textual reasoning chains through cross-attention mechanisms that align visual evidence with corresponding reasoning steps

5. **Answer Generation**: Produce final diagnostic answers along with complete reasoning pathways that include:
   - Visual evidence from identified regions
   - Step-by-step diagnostic reasoning
   - Confidence scores for each reasoning step
   - Final diagnosis with supporting rationale



The model employs a multi-task learning approach with three complementary objectives:
- **Region localization loss** to ensure accurate identification of pathological areas
- **Chain-of-thought generation loss** to produce coherent and medically sound reasoning sequences  
- **Answer accuracy loss** to maintain diagnostic performance while preserving interpretability







V2T-CoT was evaluated on multiple medical visual question answering datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness across different medical domains:

**VQA-RAD**: A radiological VQA dataset containing 3,515 question-answer pairs based on 315 radiology images, focusing on chest X-rays and brain MRIs. The dataset includes both closed-ended (yes/no) and open-ended questions requiring detailed medical reasoning.

**SLAKE**: A bilingual medical VQA dataset with 14,028 question-answer pairs covering various medical imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound. The dataset emphasizes semantic reasoning and knowledge-based medical understanding.

**PathVQA**: A pathology-focused dataset containing 32,799 question-answer pairs from 4,998 pathology images, requiring fine-grained analysis of tissue structures and cellular patterns for accurate diagnosis.

Each dataset was augmented with chain-of-thought annotations to enable supervised training of the reasoning pathway generation, ensuring the model learns to produce clinically relevant explanations alongside accurate diagnoses.



Ablation studies confirm that each component contributes significantly to performance: removing region localization reduces accuracy by 3.2%, while eliminating chain-of-thought generation decreases reasoning quality by 15% without substantially affecting answer accuracy.



- **Interpretable Medical AI**: V2T-CoT bridges the gap between diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability by providing explicit reasoning pathways
- **Region-Aware Analysis**: Disease-specific region localization ensures focus on clinically relevant image areas rather than global features
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: The chain-of-thought approach mirrors natural clinical diagnostic processes, enhancing trust and adoption potential
- **Multi-Modal Reasoning**: Effective integration of visual evidence with textual reasoning creates comprehensive diagnostic explanations suitable for clinical decision support

### 4.2 주요 결과


V2T-CoT demonstrates significant improvements in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality across all evaluated datasets:

**Diagnostic Performance**: The model achieves state-of-the-art results with accuracy improvements of 5.2% on VQA-RAD, 4.8% on SLAKE, and 6.1% on PathVQA compared to existing Med-VQA baselines. These improvements are particularly pronounced for complex open-ended questions requiring detailed medical reasoning rather than simple yes/no responses.

**Reasoning Quality**: Human evaluation by medical professionals shows that V2T-CoT generates significantly more clinically relevant and coherent reasoning pathways compared to baseline models. The chain-of-thought explanations achieve a 78% alignment score with expert medical reasoning, demonstrating the model's ability to produce interpretable diagnostic processes that mirror clinical decision-making workflows.
