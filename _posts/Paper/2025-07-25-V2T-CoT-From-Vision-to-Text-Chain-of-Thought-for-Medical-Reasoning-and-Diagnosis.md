# V2T-CoT: From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought for Medical Reasoning and Diagnosis

## 논문 정보
- **저자**: 연구진
- **발표**: AI Conference
- **ArXiv**: N/A

## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
V2T-CoT: From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought for Medical Reasoning and Diagnosis에 대한 혁신적인 연구로, 해당 분야에 중요한 기여를 제공합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) systems often focus solely on answer accuracy while neglecting the critical reasoning pathways that clinicians require for diagnosis, limiting their practical applicability in clinical settings. V2T-CoT (Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought) addresses this limitation by introducing a novel framework that combines disease-specific region localization with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling both accurate diagnosis and interpretable medical reasoning pathways that mirror clinical decision-making processes.

## 4. 실험 및 결과

### 4.1 실험 설정
V2T-CoT demonstrates significant improvements in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality across all evaluated datasets:
**Diagnostic Performance**: The model achieves state-of-the-art results with accuracy improvements of 5.2% on VQA-RAD, 4.8% on SLAKE, and 6.1% on PathVQA compared to existing Med-VQA baselines. These improvements are particularly pronounced for complex open-ended questions requiring detailed medical reasoning rather than simple yes/no responses.
**Reasoning Quality**: Human evaluation by medical professionals shows that V2T-CoT generates significantly more clinically relevant and coherent reasoning pathways compared to baseline models. The chain-of-thought explanations achieve a 78% alignment score with expert medical reasoning, demonstrating the model's ability to produce interpretable diagnostic processes that mirror clinical decision-making workflows.
