## Introduction

Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) systems often focus solely on answer accuracy while neglecting the critical reasoning pathways that clinicians require for diagnosis, limiting their practical applicability in clinical settings. V2T-CoT (Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought) addresses this limitation by introducing a novel framework that combines disease-specific region localization with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling both accurate diagnosis and interpretable medical reasoning pathways that mirror clinical decision-making processes.

## Related Work 

### Vision-Language Models

Existing vision-language models in medical domains primarily focus on global image understanding without explicit reasoning pathways, limiting their clinical interpretability.

### Computer Vision

Traditional computer vision approaches for medical diagnosis lack the multi-modal reasoning capabilities necessary for comprehensive clinical decision support.

## Methods

V2T-CoT implements a three-stage pipeline that mimics clinical diagnostic reasoning by combining visual analysis, region localization, and structured reasoning:

### Architecture Overview

The framework consists of three integrated components working in sequence to generate both accurate diagnoses and interpretable reasoning pathways.


### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Vision Encoder Stage**: Extract comprehensive visual features from medical images using a pre-trained vision transformer that captures both global context and fine-grained anatomical details necessary for medical analysis

2. **Region Localization Module**: Identify and segment disease-specific regions of interest (ROIs) using attention mechanisms that highlight pathological areas, ensuring the model focuses on clinically relevant image regions rather than irrelevant background

3. **Chain-of-Thought Generator**: Generate structured reasoning sequences that mirror clinical diagnostic workflows by:
   - Analyzing identified ROIs systematically
   - Describing observed pathological features in medical terminology
   - Connecting visual observations to potential diagnostic hypotheses
   - Providing step-by-step logical reasoning leading to final diagnosis

4. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrate visual features from localized regions with textual reasoning chains through cross-attention mechanisms that align visual evidence with corresponding reasoning steps

5. **Answer Generation**: Produce final diagnostic answers along with complete reasoning pathways that include:
   - Visual evidence from identified regions
   - Step-by-step diagnostic reasoning
   - Confidence scores for each reasoning step
   - Final diagnosis with supporting rationale

### Training Strategy

The model employs a multi-task learning approach with three complementary objectives:
- **Region localization loss** to ensure accurate identification of pathological areas
- **Chain-of-thought generation loss** to produce coherent and medically sound reasoning sequences  
- **Answer accuracy loss** to maintain diagnostic performance while preserving interpretability





## Experiments

### Dataset

V2T-CoT was evaluated on multiple medical visual question answering datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness across different medical domains:

**VQA-RAD**: A radiological VQA dataset containing 3,515 question-answer pairs based on 315 radiology images, focusing on chest X-rays and brain MRIs. The dataset includes both closed-ended (yes/no) and open-ended questions requiring detailed medical reasoning.

**SLAKE**: A bilingual medical VQA dataset with 14,028 question-answer pairs covering various medical imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound. The dataset emphasizes semantic reasoning and knowledge-based medical understanding.

**PathVQA**: A pathology-focused dataset containing 32,799 question-answer pairs from 4,998 pathology images, requiring fine-grained analysis of tissue structures and cellular patterns for accurate diagnosis.

Each dataset was augmented with chain-of-thought annotations to enable supervised training of the reasoning pathway generation, ensuring the model learns to produce clinically relevant explanations alongside accurate diagnoses.

### Results

V2T-CoT demonstrates significant improvements in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality across all evaluated datasets:

**Diagnostic Performance**: The model achieves state-of-the-art results with accuracy improvements of 5.2% on VQA-RAD, 4.8% on SLAKE, and 6.1% on PathVQA compared to existing Med-VQA baselines. These improvements are particularly pronounced for complex open-ended questions requiring detailed medical reasoning rather than simple yes/no responses.

**Reasoning Quality**: Human evaluation by medical professionals shows that V2T-CoT generates significantly more clinically relevant and coherent reasoning pathways compared to baseline models. The chain-of-thought explanations achieve a 78% alignment score with expert medical reasoning, demonstrating the model's ability to produce interpretable diagnostic processes that mirror clinical decision-making workflows.

### Ablation Studies

Ablation studies confirm that each component contributes significantly to performance: removing region localization reduces accuracy by 3.2%, while eliminating chain-of-thought generation decreases reasoning quality by 15% without substantially affecting answer accuracy.

## Conclusion

V2T-CoT represents a significant advancement in medical VQA by successfully combining accurate diagnosis with interpretable reasoning pathways, making AI-assisted medical diagnosis more clinically viable and trustworthy.

## Key Takeaways

- **Interpretable Medical AI**: V2T-CoT bridges the gap between diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability by providing explicit reasoning pathways
- **Region-Aware Analysis**: Disease-specific region localization ensures focus on clinically relevant image areas rather than global features
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: The chain-of-thought approach mirrors natural clinical diagnostic processes, enhancing trust and adoption potential
- **Multi-Modal Reasoning**: Effective integration of visual evidence with textual reasoning creates comprehensive diagnostic explanations suitable for clinical decision support
