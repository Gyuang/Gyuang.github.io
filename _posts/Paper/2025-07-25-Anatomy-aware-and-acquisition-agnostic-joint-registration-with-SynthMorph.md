## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
이 논문의 핵심 기여와 주요 발견을 간결하게 요약합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Affine image registration is a cornerstone of medical image analysis that aligns brain images for comparative studies and preprocessing pipelines. While classical optimization-based algorithms achieve excellent accuracy, they require time-consuming optimization for every image pair and struggle with anatomy-specific alignment requirements. SynthMorph addresses these limitations by introducing a deep learning approach that is both anatomy-aware and acquisition-agnostic, enabling fast and robust registration across diverse neuroimaging protocols without preprocessing.

## 3. 제안 방법

### 3.1 아키텍처 개요


### 3.2 핵심 기술/알고리즘
The SynthMorph methodology introduces several key innovations for robust medical image registration:

1. **Synthetic Training Data Generation**: Train networks exclusively using synthetically generated images from 100 whole-head tissue segmentations sourced from UKBB, OASIS, ABCD, and infant scan datasets

2. **Three Core Affine Registration Architectures**: 
   - Parameter Encoder: Directly predicts affine transformation parameters
   - Warp Decomposer: Decomposes displacement fields into affine components
   - Feature Detector: Extracts anatomical features for registration guidance

3. **Anatomy-Aware Optimization**: Optimize spatial overlap of select anatomical labels rather than all image structures, enabling networks to distinguish anatomy of interest from irrelevant structures

4. **Hypernetwork Integration**: Combine affine model with deformable hypernetwork that allows users to dynamically choose optimal deformation-field regularity at registration time

5. **Acquisition-Agnostic Training**: Apply random spatial transformations and image corruption during training to ensure robustness across different MRI contrasts, resolutions, and acquisition protocols

6. **Joint Affine-Deformable Registration**: Provide end-to-end solution combining both affine and deformable registration in a single framework

7. **Loss Function Design**: Utilize mean squared error loss function to optimize label overlap while maintaining spatial consistency through Jacobian regularization




The evaluation encompasses an extremely diverse set of neuroimaging data to capture real-world performance. Training data includes 100 tissue segmentations from major neuroimaging datasets (UKBB, OASIS, ABCD, infant scans). Evaluation datasets span multiple MRI contrasts including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted images with varying resolutions (0.4-1.2 mm) and subject populations ranging from ages 0-75 years, covering both adult and pediatric brain imaging scenarios.

### 4.2 주요 결과


SynthMorph demonstrates superior performance across diverse neuroimaging scenarios with significant improvements over classical methods. Key findings include high Dice overlap scores between transformed and fixed label maps, improved normalized cross-correlation of neighborhood descriptors, and optimal log-Jacobian spread for deformation field regularity. The method achieves fast registration times while maintaining accuracy comparable to or exceeding classical optimization-based approaches. Importantly, SynthMorph generalizes effectively across different MRI acquisition protocols without requiring domain-specific retraining, addressing the critical domain shift problem that limits other deep learning registration methods.
