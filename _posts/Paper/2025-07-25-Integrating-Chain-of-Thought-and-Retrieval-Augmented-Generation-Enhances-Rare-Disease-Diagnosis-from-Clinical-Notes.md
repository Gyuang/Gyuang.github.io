## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes에 대한 혁신적인 연구로, 해당 분야에 중요한 기여를 제공합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Rare disease diagnosis from clinical notes presents significant challenges due to the complexity of phenotype-driven gene prioritization and the unstructured nature of real-world clinical documentation. This paper addresses these challenges by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance large language models' ability to process unstructured clinical notes and improve rare disease diagnostic accuracy.

### 4.1 실험 설정
The integration of Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrated significant improvements in rare disease diagnosis accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The method showed enhanced performance in gene prioritization tasks, with notable improvements in handling complex phenotypic presentations and ambiguous clinical descriptions. The systematic reasoning approach enabled by CoT, combined with the domain-specific knowledge provided by RAG, resulted in more accurate and clinically relevant diagnostic suggestions, particularly for cases where traditional HPO-based approaches struggled with the unstructured nature of clinical documentation.
