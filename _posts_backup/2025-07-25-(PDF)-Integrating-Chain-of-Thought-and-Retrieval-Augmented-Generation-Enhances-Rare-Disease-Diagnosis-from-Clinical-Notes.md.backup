## Introduction

Rare disease diagnosis remains challenging due to the complexity of interpreting unstructured clinical notes and linking phenotypic descriptions to genetic causes. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance phenotype-driven gene prioritization directly from clinical notes, bypassing the need for structured Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms.

## Methods

The proposed framework combines CoT reasoning and RAG to process clinical notes for rare disease diagnosis through the following steps:

1. **Clinical Note Preprocessing**: Raw clinical notes are processed to extract relevant phenotypic information while preserving contextual relationships between symptoms and clinical observations

2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: The system employs step-by-step reasoning to:
   - Identify key phenotypic features from unstructured text
   - Establish relationships between symptoms and potential genetic causes
   - Generate intermediate reasoning steps that mirror clinical diagnostic thinking

3. **Knowledge Base Construction**: A comprehensive knowledge base is built containing:
   - Gene-phenotype associations from databases like OMIM and ClinVar
   - Disease descriptions and genetic mechanisms
   - Clinical case examples with confirmed diagnoses

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: For each clinical case, the system:
   - Retrieves relevant gene-phenotype associations from the knowledge base
   - Selects the most pertinent information based on extracted phenotypes
   - Augments the language model's context with retrieved knowledge

5. **Integrated Reasoning Pipeline**: CoT and RAG components work together by:
   - Using CoT to generate structured reasoning about phenotype-gene relationships
   - Leveraging RAG to provide evidence-based support for each reasoning step
   - Combining retrieved knowledge with step-by-step logical inference

6. **Gene Prioritization**: The final output ranks candidate genes based on:
   - Relevance scores from retrieved knowledge
   - Confidence scores from CoT reasoning steps
   - Combined evidence from multiple phenotypic features





## Dataset

The study evaluates the approach using clinical datasets containing unstructured notes from rare disease cases. The evaluation dataset includes real clinical notes with confirmed genetic diagnoses, allowing for assessment of gene prioritization accuracy. The knowledge base incorporates comprehensive gene-phenotype associations from established medical databases, providing the retrieval component with authoritative medical knowledge for supporting the diagnostic reasoning process.

## Results

The integrated CoT+RAG approach demonstrates significant improvements in rare disease diagnosis accuracy compared to baseline methods. The system shows enhanced performance in gene prioritization tasks, with the combination of structured reasoning and knowledge retrieval proving more effective than either approach alone. Key findings include improved handling of complex phenotypic presentations and better generalization to unseen rare disease cases, validating the effectiveness of combining reasoning-based and retrieval-based approaches for clinical decision support.

## Conclusion

This work demonstrates that integrating Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation significantly enhances rare disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes. The approach successfully addresses key challenges in clinical NLP by combining systematic reasoning with evidence-based knowledge retrieval, offering a promising direction for automated clinical decision support systems.

## Key Takeaways

- CoT reasoning helps structure the diagnostic thinking process from unstructured clinical text
- RAG provides essential medical knowledge to support evidence-based gene prioritization
- The integrated approach outperforms individual methods for rare disease diagnosis
- Direct processing of clinical notes eliminates the need for structured HPO term conversion
- The framework shows strong potential for real-world clinical applications
