    "caption": "A3 (Ours) The treatment of periodontitis requires a comprehensive approach that considers risk factors, scaling and root planing, oral antibiotics, and local medications. For all cases of periodontitis, the first stage of treatment involves thorough cleaning, scaling and root planing, and reinforcement of daily oral hygiene. If deep periodontal pockets are present, systemic antibiotics may be used, with amoxicillin 500mg orally, three times a day for 10 days being a commonly used method. The second stage of treatment involves surgical removal of periodontal pockets and bone reshaping to allow the patient to self-clean the base of the gingival sulcus. Localized aggressive periodontitis requires periodontal surgery in combination with oral antibiotics. At the same time, systemic factors such as poor oral hygiene, diabetes, and smoking must be controlled to improve the prognosis. Therefore, drug therapy alone is not sufficient and comprehensive treatment is necessary.",
