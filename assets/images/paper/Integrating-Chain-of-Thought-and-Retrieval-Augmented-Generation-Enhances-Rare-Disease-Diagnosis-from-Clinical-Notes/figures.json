(a) PaCMAP projection revealing three distinct clusters: HPO Database documents (I, purple), mixed OMIM and HPO documents (II, teal), and OMIM Database documents (III, orange). (b) PacMAP of documents embeddings from OMIM (green) and HPO (yellow) with RAG-driven CoT query vectors (Phenopacket-derived clinical notes: diamonds, PubMed Free-text: squares, in-house clinical notes: crosses) distributed across multiple clusters. (c) Same embeddings with CoT-driven RAG query vectors. (d) Distribution of document length in Knowledge Base. This histogram shows the distribution of document lengths (in tokens) across our knowledge base containing 64,068 documents. The light blue bars represent frequency counts, while the red curve indicates the kernel density estimate. Vertical dashed lines mark the mean (289.2 tokens, orange) and median (285.0 tokens, green) values. (e) Document length distribution of OMIM Database containing 48,136 documents. (f) Document length distribution of HPO Database containing 15,762 documents.",
