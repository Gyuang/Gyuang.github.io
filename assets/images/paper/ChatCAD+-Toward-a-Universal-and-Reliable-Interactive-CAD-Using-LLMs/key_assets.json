The numerical results obtained from these models are transformed into visual descriptions following the rule of prob2text. (b) Hierarchical in-context learning: The LLM initially generates a preliminary report based on the visual description, which is then enhanced through in-context learning using retrieved semantically similar reports. LLM and CLIP models are kept frozen, while CAD models are denoted as trainable as they can be continually trained and updated without interfering with other components.",
