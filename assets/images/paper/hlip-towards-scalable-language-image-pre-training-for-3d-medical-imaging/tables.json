Given that recent 3D models such as Merlin [(<>)4] and M3D [(<>)5] do not include brain MRI in their training sets, we evaluate two 2D foundation models on our benchmark: BiomedCLIP [(<>)23], pre-trained on 15 million figure-caption pairs from PubMed, and ConceptCLIP [(<>)24], pre-trained on 23 million such pairs. We use the prompt \"This brain MRI shows: {disease}.\" to perform zero-shot inference [(<>)2] with both models. Since both models require 2D inputs, we generate predictions for each study by applying average pooling and max pooling to the outputs across all slices. We observe that max pooling consistently yields positive predictions and is only suitable for binary classification; accordingly, we adopt average pooling for both models. Additionally, on Pub-Brain-5-GT, we assess an upper-bound scenario in which predictions are made only on lesion-containing slices. Note that this setting is not practical, as it requires manually annotation for the lesion locations.",

To measure throughput, we include 100 warm-up iterations and compute the average over 1000 forward passes. As shown in Table (<>)9, when not using flash attention [(<>)19], Swin is slightly faster than the original ViT but still lags behind our HLIP visual encoder. Swin also consumes more memory during training due to the large codebook of relative position embeddings constructed for 3D inputs. Moreover, Swin is not compatible with flash attention, which has been integrated into PyTorch 2.0 and supports a wide range of GPUs. We acknowledge that when using flash attention, the memory efficiency advantage of our hierarchical attention is reduced, since we do not alter the actual feature map size. However, HLIP remains faster than the original ViT.",
