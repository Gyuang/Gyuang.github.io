On SSPH dataset (the first part in Tab. (<>)2), AutoRG-Brain-Prompt trained on both SSPH and RadGenome-Brain MRI reaches the best performance, achieving a RadGraph score of 41.74±15.93%, a RadCliQ score of 0.30±0.48, and a RaTEScore of 68.76±12.53%. Additionally, AutoRG-Brain-AutoSeg pre-trained on SSPH and RadGenome-Brain MRI reaches the second best result, which indicates the effectiveness of incorporating the grounded visual clues into report generation. On RadGenome-Brain MRI dataset, AutoRG-Brain-Prompt pre-trained on RadGenome-Brain MRI outperforms all baselines with a RadGraph score of 28.75±13.89%, a RadCliQ score of 0.54±0.37, and a RaTEScore of 46.65±14.02%. The result sets a new benchmark on our proposed open-source brain MRI grounded report generation dataset, which we hope will drive further development of grounded report generation in the research community.",
