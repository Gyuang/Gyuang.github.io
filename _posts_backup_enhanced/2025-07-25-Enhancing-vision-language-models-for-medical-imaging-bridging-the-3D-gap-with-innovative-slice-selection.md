## 1. 핵심 요약 (2-3문장)
이 논문의 핵심 기여와 주요 발견을 간결하게 요약합니다.

## 2. 배경 및 동기
Vision-language models (VLMs) are primarily designed for 2D inputs, which creates a significant gap when applying them to 3D medical imaging such as MRI and CT scans. This paper introduces Vote-MI, an innovative one-pass, unsupervised representative slice selection method that bridges this 3D gap by intelligently selecting the most representative 2D slices from 3D medical images, enabling existing 2D VLMs to effectively process 3D medical data.

## 3. 제안 방법

### 3.1 아키텍처 개요


### 3.2 핵심 기술/알고리즘
Existing vision-language models like CLIP, BLIP, and Med-Flamingo have shown remarkable success in various tasks but are primarily designed for 2D inputs. This limitation becomes particularly challenging in medical imaging where 3D scans (MRI, CT) are the standard. Previous approaches either processed all slices individually or used simple averaging, both of which fail to capture the most representative information efficiently.



Traditional approaches to 3D medical image analysis include 3D CNNs and volumetric processing methods. However, these approaches require significant computational resources and cannot leverage the powerful pre-trained 2D vision-language models. The Vote-MI method bridges this gap by enabling existing 2D models to work effectively with 3D medical data.





The core innovation of this paper is the Vote-MI (Voting-based Medical Imaging) method, which addresses the 3D gap through the following step-by-step approach:

1. **3D Medical Image Input**: Start with a 3D medical image (MRI or CT scan) containing multiple 2D slices
2. **Unsupervised Analysis**: Apply one-pass, unsupervised analysis to evaluate each slice within the 3D volume
3. **Representative Slice Identification**: Use voting mechanism to identify the most representative 2D slice that best captures the critical medical information
4. **Slice Selection**: Select the optimal slice(s) that maximize information content while maintaining compatibility with 2D VLMs
5. **VLM Processing**: Feed the selected representative 2D slice to existing vision-language models (specifically Med-Flamingo)
6. **Medical Report Generation**: Generate medical reports or perform downstream tasks using the processed 2D representation




- **One-Pass Processing**: Efficient single-pass algorithm for slice evaluation
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No requirement for labeled training data for slice selection
- **Voting Mechanism**: Systematic approach to rank and select the most informative slices
- **Med-Flamingo Integration**: Seamless integration with existing 2D vision-language models







**BrainMD Dataset**: The authors introduce BrainMD, a comprehensive multimodal dataset specifically designed for this research. It comprises 2,453 annotated 3D MRI brain scans with corresponding textual radiology reports and electronic health records. This dataset serves as the foundation for developing and evaluating the Vote-MI method.

**Benchmark Tasks**: Based on BrainMD, two benchmarks were developed:
- **BrainMD-select**: Focuses on evaluating the most representative 2D slice selection from 3D images
- **BrainBench**: Includes various vision-language downstream tasks for comprehensive evaluation



The paper includes comprehensive ablation studies examining different components of the Vote-MI method. Key findings from the ablation studies show that the voting mechanism is crucial for identifying the most representative slices, and the one-pass approach significantly improves computational efficiency compared to multi-pass alternatives. The studies also validate the effectiveness of the unsupervised approach across different types of medical imaging tasks.



- **3D Gap Solution**: Vote-MI effectively solves the fundamental mismatch between 3D medical images and 2D vision-language models through intelligent slice selection
- **Unsupervised Approach**: The method requires no labeled training data for slice selection, making it practical for real-world medical applications
- **Substantial Performance Gains**: Demonstrates 14.6-16.6% absolute improvements over random selection in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios
- **Clinical Relevance**: The BrainMD dataset and benchmarks provide valuable resources for future medical AI research
- **Practical Integration**: The approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing 2D VLMs like Med-Flamingo without architectural modifications
